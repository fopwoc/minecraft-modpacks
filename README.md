# fopwoc's Minecraft modpacks

***The "Gentoo" way to play minecraft*** – Why just share zip with your friends when you can write a CI for your modpack?

Inspired and partially based on [Deckium](https://github.com/skywardmc/deckcraft) and [Fabulously Optimized](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/) modpacks.

### What does "YAqol&oM" means?
Y - Yet  
A - Another  
q - quality  
o - of  
l - life  
& - and  
o - optimization  
M - Modpack  

### So… what is it?
 
My personal vanilla-compatible modpack focuses on quality of Life, fixes, and optimization. It also includes numerous platform-related fixes (Mac and Linux issues) and features [a well-designed Steam Deck layout](https://github.com/fopwoc/minecraft-modpacks/blob/master/base/1.20.1/config/yosbr/config/controlify.json).


### Performace? 

Certainly! It incorporates nearly all modern and widely-used optimization mods. Here's a brief list of them:
- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) – better rendering engine.
- [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) – Sodium addon with additional features and optimizations.
- [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight) – light engine rewrite.
- [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) – game logic optimization.
- [Exordium](https://modrinth.com/mod/exordium) – HUD framerate render fix.
- [ImmediatelyFast](https://modrinth.com/mod/immediatelyfast) – faster entity, particles, etc. rendering.
- [More Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/moreculling) – better culling, huge performance boost.
- [DashLoader](https://modrinth.com/mod/dashloader) – caches game data and makes it load super fast.
- [ModernFix](https://modrinth.com/mod/modernfix) – an all-in-one fix and tweak mod for various aspects of the game.
- And more...

Compared to vanilla without mods, it offers a substantial performance boost and runs exceptionally well on my M1 Mac.

### Qol?

Absolutely! Everyone appreciates comfort, right? This modpack includes numerous useful mods that will make you never want to play without them again.
- [CustomHud](https://modrinth.com/mod/customhud) – I love seeing IRL time when playing the game. This is the best vanilla-looking HUD mod that lets me see it.
- [Shulker Box Tooltip](https://modrinth.com/mod/shulkerboxtooltip) – You never remember what inside shulker boxes. So why not to preview them.
- [Auto Elytra](https://modrinth.com/mod/auto-elytra) – Automatically switch chestplate to elytra and vice versa.
- [Controlify](https://modrinth.com/mod/controlify) – Controller support with many great features.
- [Chat Patches](https://modrinth.com/mod/chatpatches) – This mod makes chat great again.
- [Durability Viewer](https://modrinth.com/mod/durabilityviewer) – Useful for seeing the exact durability left with your items.
- [Inventory Profiles Next](https://modrinth.com/mod/inventory-profiles-next) – ADHD inventory sorting. But also has a lot of awesome invetory managment features.
- [Chest Tracker](https://modrinth.com/mod/chest-tracker) – Helps you find in which chest your certain items are located.
- [ChatWalk](https://modrinth.com/mod/chatwalk) – Useful when you need to travel straight for a long distance but are too lazy to press the W button all the time (though not the main purpose of this mod).
- [Xaero's World Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map) – The best world map and waypoints mod ever existed.
- [Ok Zoomer](https://modrinth.com/mod/ok-zoomer) – My personal favorite zooming mod. This mod is literally only one reason why I use Quilt over Fabric :)
- And so much more…
