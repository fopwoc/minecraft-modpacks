# fopwoc's Minecraft modpacks

***Gentoo way to play minecraft*** – why just share zip with your friends if you can write CI for you modpack?

Inspired and partially based on [Deckium](https://github.com/skywardmc/deckcraft) and [Fabulously Optimized](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/)

### What does "YAqol&oM" means?
Y - Yet  
A - Another  
q - quality  
o - of  
l - life  
& - and  
o - optimization  
M - Modpack  

### So… what is it?
 
My personal vanilla compatible modpack focused on QoL, fixes and optimization. Also it contains a lot of platform related fixes (mac and linux issues) and [pretty good Steam Deck layout](https://github.com/fopwoc/minecraft-modpacks/blob/master/base/1.20.1/config/yosbr/config/controlify.json).


### Performace? 

Yeah, it has almost all modern and most used optimization mods. Here brief list of them:
- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) – better rendering engine.
- [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) – Sodium addon, more features and optimizations.
- [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight) – light engine rewrite.
- [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) – game logic optimization.
- [Exordium](https://modrinth.com/mod/exordium) – ui framerate render fix.
- [ImmediatelyFast](https://modrinth.com/mod/immediatelyfast) – faster entity, particles, etc. renedere.
- [More Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/moreculling) – better culling, huge performance boost.
- [DashLoader](https://modrinth.com/mod/dashloader) – caches game data and makes it load super fast.
- [ModernFix](https://modrinth.com/mod/modernfix) – all in one fixes and tweeks for many aspects of the game.
- etc.

Comparing with no mods vanilla, it has a great performance boost, it works so well on my M1 Mac.

### Qol?

Sure, everyone likes to feel comfort, right? This modpack has so many useful mods, that will make you never ever play without them.
- [CustomHud](https://modrinth.com/mod/customhud) – I love to see irl time when playing the game. This is the best vanilla-looking hud mod lets me see it.
- [Shulker Box Tooltip](https://modrinth.com/mod/shulkerboxtooltip) – You never remember what inside shulker boxes. So why not to preview them.
- [Auto Elytra](https://modrinth.com/mod/auto-elytra) – auto switch chestplate to elytra and backwords.
- [Controlify](https://modrinth.com/mod/controlify) – controller support with so many great features.
- [Chat Patches](https://modrinth.com/mod/chatpatches) – this mod makes chat great again.
- [Durability Viewer](https://modrinth.com/mod/durabilityviewer) – it so useful to see what exactly durability has left with your items.
- [Inventory Profiles Next](https://modrinth.com/mod/inventory-profiles-next) – ADHD inventory sorting. But also has a lot of invetory managment features.
- [Chest Tracker](https://modrinth.com/mod/chest-tracker) – helps you find in which chest your certain items.
- [ChatWalk](https://modrinth.com/mod/chatwalk) – so useful when you need to travel straight for long distance, but you are too lazy to press W button all the time. (not main purpose of this mode)
- [Xaero's World Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map) – best world map and waypoints mod ever existed.
- [Ok Zoomer](https://modrinth.com/mod/ok-zoomer) – literally the most awesome zoom mode with the smoothest user experience I ever had. The most important reason why I use quilt over fabric :)
- and so much more…

### You said it works nice on Steam Deck?
